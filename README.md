## Resume tips:
1. Tailor your resume to the job
   -  Customize your resume for each job you apply to by highlighting relevant skills, experiences, and achievements that match the job requirements. Use keywords from the job posting to demonstrate how you can contribute to the organization.

2. Focus on accomplishments over responsibilities
   -  Instead of just listing your job responsibilities, focus on specific accomplishments and achievements in your previous roles. Quantify your achievements by using numbers and metrics wherever possible (e.g., "Increased sales by 25% within 6 months" instead of "Responsible for selling products").

3. Use a clear and concise format
   -  Use a clean, easy-to-read format with bullet points, headings, and white space to make your resume scannable and visually appealing. Keep it concise and focused on the most important information.

4. Use action verbs 
   -  Use strong action verbs like "Managed," "Created," "Developed," and "Improved" to start each bullet point, as they help to convey a sense of accomplishment.
    
5. Include relevant sections or certifications
   -  If you have relevant certifications (e.g., language skills, programming languages, or industry-specific certifications), include them on your resume. You can also add relevant sections like "Projects," "Volunteer Experience," or "Relevant Tools" to showcase your skills and interests.

For example:

Before:
  -  Managed a team of 5 people
  -  Developed a marketing strategy for a new product launch

After:
  -  **Implemented** & led process improvement initiative that streamlined tasks and reduced meeting time by 25% resulting in increased productivity among team members.
  -  **Developed** a comprehensive marketing strategy for product launchwa, including targeted social media campaigns, email marketing, and influencer partnerships generating $1 million in revenue within the first quarter and received widespread industry recognition.

*Remember to tailor your accomplishments to the specific job you're applying for, and be honest about what you've achieved.*
